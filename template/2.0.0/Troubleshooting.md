# Troubleshooting
Occasionally you may run into issues with GeckoLib. Before submitting an issue, please read through this page first.

* **Animation isn't playing** - Check the console for logs, make sure GeckoLib is able to find the path to your animation file and the animation name's you are specifying are *exactly* what they are in the json file. Additionally, make sure you actually registered your AnimationController to your AnimationControllerCollection. Put a breakpoint in your AnimationPredicate and make sure it's actually being run. Read more about this [here.](../Animation-Controllers)

* **Animation only plays once** - Make sure that you set your animation to loop in blockbench. You can always use the overload of `AnimationBuilder#setAnimation()` that takes a loop parameter. This will override the loop value set in blockbench. Additionally, you can also set `AnimatedEntityModel#loopByDefault = true`, which will make every animation loop by default.

* **Animations take too long/too short to transition** - Make sure your transition length is in ticks. You can change this value in the `AnimationController` constructor or by setting the field directly.

* **Bytecode not matching/IllegalAccessException/ATs not working**
For 1.15 forge, make sure you have `fg.deobf("url")`. Otherwise, forge won't remap geckolib to your current mappings. If you are using 1.12, you'll have to use ForgeGradle 2. We're not sure why it doesn't work on 1.12 FG 3, but there is little to no official support for 1.12 anyway.
For forge 1.12, make sure you have this in your minecraft block:
```groovy
minecraft {
    useDepAts = true
}
```
