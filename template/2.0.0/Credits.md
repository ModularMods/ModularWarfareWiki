GeckoLib was developed mostly by me, Gecko. Several other people contributed assets, art, and code. Thank you to these people:

- Enormous thank you to [Eliot Lash](https://github.com/fadookie) for the help porting to fabric, work on the geckolib blockbench plugin, and easing implementation.

- The Ult1mate Guy, NerevarDZN, Slumberous Carp, and Lewbae for the assets and designs
